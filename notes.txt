compliant_finger_4: too stiff as predicted by the simulations
compliant_finger_5: good stiffness but since the holes are too central, pulling down the string does not actuate that well
		    holes for hex nuts are too small and need to be enlarged by 0.2 - 0.3mm to 6.2mm
compliant_finger_7: actuation works well, however hex nut hole is too big so that the nut falls through when being pulled
